# DeepLearning-ImageProcessing-CNN
An Image Recognition System, which would recognize if the image is a Dog or a Cat.
Dataset consisted of about 10000 images of dogs and cats.
Data Preprocessing was done and the following four steps were involved in processing.
Convolution, Max Pooling, Flattening and Full Connection are the main four steps involved in Processing.
An accuracy of 85% was obtained on Training Set(8000 images) and 82% on Testing set(2000 images).
